## About Unusual Project

Unusual Project is an unintelligent and a loser web application with nonsense content, foolish syntax. We believe development must be a painful and lack of experience to be truly fulfilling. Unusual Project takes the happiness out of development because it contains a bunch of pieces of sh*t. The project includes:

Unusual Project is Unaccessible, Slow, and Lack of user experiences.
